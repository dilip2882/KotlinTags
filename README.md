# KotlinTags

**KotlinTags** is a small, lightweight library for building **HTML** and **XML** documents in Kotlin using a type-safe, composable Domain-Specific Language (DSL). It allows you to create structured, readable markup with Kotlin code, avoiding the need for manually concatenating strings or relying on verbose templating engines.

This library is designed to provide a simple, Kotlin-friendly alternative to generate HTML and XML in a concise and safe manner.

## Features

- **Type-safe HTML/XML generation**: Create HTML or XML elements using Kotlin’s type system, ensuring that tags and attributes are properly formatted.
- **Composable**: Build complex documents by composing smaller pieces together.
- **No dependencies**: Lightweight and doesn’t require heavy external libraries.
- **Readable syntax**: Kotlin's DSL capabilities provide clean, easy-to-understand code for HTML/XML generation.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable to support additional HTML or custom XML tags.
